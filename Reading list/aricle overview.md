++++ Mixed-phase clouds ++++
- Costa et al. 2017: nice classification of mixed-phase clouds
- Morrison et al. 2011: probably one of the most cited papers on Arctic mixed-phase clouds, gives you a great overview about different processes that maintain the clouds, definitely relevant when we are trying to investigate possible reasons for the cloud breakup later
- Griesche et al. 2021: great paper contrasting the ice formation in Arctic clouds if they are coupled to the surface or not
- Tan and Storelvmo, 2019: study on effect of mixed-phase clouds on climate change using a model informed by satellite observations, also relevant for big picture
- Korolev et al. 2017: overview of mixed-phase clouds, can get quite technical don't worry, just for an overview also with regard to thermodynamics


++++ Cloud breakup ++++
- Karalis et al., 2022: effect of secondary ice production on the cloud breakup during a cold air outbreak, even though it is a pure modelling study this is highly relevant for you and will give you a lot of good pointers
- Schneider et al., 2019: modelling study on the climate influence of the breakup of marine stratocumulus clouds
- Goren et al., 2019: influence of anthropogenic air pollution on the breakup from closed to open cell (modelling and satellite study)
- Rebecca et al., 2023: Investigating the development of clouds within marine cold-air outbreaks https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/9365/2023/


++++ Remote sensing of clouds ++++
- Mace et al. 2021: nice paper on remote sensing of mixed-phase clouds in high latitudes (Southern Ocean), which gives you a good introduction to satellite observations as well
- Mioche et al. 2015: similar than the Mace 2021 paper, but for the Arctic (Svalbard region)
- Matus and L'Ecuyer 2017: important paper highlighting the influence of mixed-phase clouds on the Earth's radiation budget, so an important read to connect your findings to the big picture


++++ Satellite observations of clouds ++++
- Stephens et al., 2002: Overview of the CloudSat mission, from which you will use data
- Winker et al., 2010: Overview of the Calipso mission, from which you will use data
- MODIS Cloud User Guide: Overview of MODIS cloud retrievals, from which you will use data, gives a good overview of passive satellite measurements, but again: can become quite technical, don't feel the need to understand all at once, use it as an introduction and skip difficult parts or just pick what you find interesting


++++ IPCC overview chapters ++++
- IPCC Chapter 7: Clouds and Energy budget
- IPCC Chapter 9: there is a section about sea ice that is relevant for you
